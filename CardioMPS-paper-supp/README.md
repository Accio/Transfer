Supplementary file for the publication _Disease molecular information to empower drug discovery: a proof of concept study_ by Drawnel _et al._

* Code to generate pathway activity scores: _myGage.R_.
* Code to re-analysed published GEO studies:
 * Collect data: _collect-data.R_ and _collect-data-2.R_ (the data were collected in two batches ochronographically).
 * Re-analyse the data and associate pathway activity patterns: _meta-analysis.Rmd_.

Note that for the function to execute you may need to install the ribios package suite, which is open-source and freely available from [GitHub](https://github.com/Accio/ribios).
